Repository hosting all the data for my university Final Year Project, from reports to source code.

## Running the API
In order to run the API, you must set the following environment variable:
`unify_jwtPrivateKey=[yourOwnPrivateKey]`

Without this environment variable, the JWT service will not run and the API process will exit.
